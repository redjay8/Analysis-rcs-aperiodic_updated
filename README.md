##Script Explanation




## Important: File and Data Structure
This project follows a specific directory structure to keep code and data organized. Below is an overview of this structure:  

Umbrella/  
├── Code/  
│   └── ... (your scripts and code files)  
└── Data/  
├── RCS02/  
│   └── ... (data files for RCS02)  
├── RCS03/  
│   └── ... (data files for RCS03)  
├── ...  
└── RCS20/  
└── ... (data files for RCS20)  

All scripts were ran on the curated RCS 3 Day Sprint Data arranged by RCS number.  

### Directory Explanations

* **`Umbrella/`**: This is the root directory for the entire project. All other project-related files and folders are contained within this "Umbrella" folder.

* **`Umbrella/Code/`**:
    * **Purpose**: This folder contains all the executable code, scripts, and source files for the project.
    * **Usage**: Any scripts or programs should be run from within this `Code` directory. For example, if you have a Python script named `main_script.py`, you would typically navigate to this folder in your terminal to run it.

* **`Umbrella/Data/`**:
    * **Purpose**: This folder is designated for storing all input data, intermediate data, and output data used or generated by the project.
    * **Organization**: Data is further organized into subdirectories named `RCS02`, `RCS03`, ..., up to `RCS20`.
        * Each `RCSXX` folder (e.g., `RCS05`) corresponds to an individual `Left`, `Right` dataset for that subject.
        * Your local absolute path might be something like `/Users/xx/Library/Working/Data/RCS05 3 day sprint`.

### How to Implement and Use

1.  When you clone or download this project, ensure the `Umbrella/` folder is your main project directory. Ensure specparam with regularisation is installed.
2.  **Place Data**:
    * Ensure your data is organized into the respective `RCS02` through `RCS20` subfolders within the `Umbrella/Data/` directory.
3.  **Run Code**: Navigate to the `Umbrella/Code/` directory to execute any scripts. Ensure your scripts are written to find data in the `../Data/RCSXX/` relative path or can be configured to find the data.


## Pipeline Architecture

### Step 1 – Generate Master RC+S file & extract electrodes (MATLAB)
- Step1_github.m
- check_contact_validity.m
**Output**: Master `.mat` file containing all neural time series data with metadata

### Step 2 – Align PSD with contralateral PKG, Apply QC and Filter (MATLAB) 
- run with Batch_Step2_Runx.m

**Output**: Aligned PSD segments with PKG scores in CSV format


### Step 3 – Perform spectral analysis with modified FOOOF and split data into clinical states (PYTHON) 
- step3_github-updated-specparam.ipynb
  for updated specparam with regularisation function
- step3_github_old_fooof.ipynb
  for old fooof implementation
- https://github.com/redjay8/fooof_specparam_regularisation
  for specparam with regularisation
**Output**: Master CSV with all spectral features, clinical states, and metadata

### Step 4 – Perform statistical analysis, MLR modelling and visualisation (PYTHON)
- step4_github_fix.ipynb
**Output**: Statistical plots + csv.
